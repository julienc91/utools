utools
======

A set of useful functions to use in any Python project.

You can go straight to the API documentation here: :ref:`ref_api`.

Description
===========

``utools`` is a Python 3 library that gather multiple useful functions for
various domains. Developers often have their own private tool library; ``utools``
is just one of them being publicly released. It does not claim to be exhaustive,
always optimized and clearly implemented, but it certainly does the job.

Even if ``utools`` is at first a personal collection of snippets,
every developer is invited to use it and contribute to its code.


Compatibility
=============

Currently supported versions and implementations of Python are:

* python 3.3
* python 3.4
* python 3.5
* pypy3

Others might be compatible but are not officially supported.


Requirements
============

Required libraries are automatically installed when installing ``utools`` (see :ref:install to learn more).
In its current version, ``utools`` only requires additional libraries to run the tests and build the documentation:

* pytest 2.9.1
* pytest-cov-2.2.1
* Sphinx 1.4.1
* sphinx-autobuild 0.6.0
