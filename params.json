Developers often have their own private tool library; ``utools``\r\nis just one of them being publicly released. It does not claim to be exhaustive,\r\nalways optimized and clearly implemented, but it certainly does the job.\r\n\r\nMost of the functions were specially designed to work with projects like [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam)\r\nand [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/).\r\n\r\nEven if ``utools`` is at first a personal collection of snippets,\r\nevery developer is invited to use it and contribute to its code.\r\n\r\n\r\nContent\r\n-------\r\n\r\n* prime generators\r\n* prime tester\r\n* binomial coefficient calculator\r\n* file parser\r\n* more to use and more to come!\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe complete documentation is available at: http://utools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\r\n",
